## About Me  

I’m a **transformational leader driving brand success, customer experience, and innovation. My work sits at the intersection of **technology, creativity, and human resilience.**  

I’ve worn many hats—branding consultant, Chief Culture Officer, MarTech Director, Salesforce enabler, AI keynote speaker. But my story goes deeper:  

- 🌎 **Venezuela → U.S. → Mexico** → Migrated through reinvention. Home can be portable.  
- 🎹 Played keyboards at *Felabration 2016* in Oakland, in front of 500 people.  
- 🎥 Produced a music video for Elvis Crespo & Ilegales as my first gig in Mexico.  
- 💼 Grew into **Data & Insights Manager → Chief Culture Officer → MarTech Director**.  
- 🎓 Salesforce certified & enabled **25+ teammates** to earn their certifications.  
- 🇲🇽 Became a **Mexican citizen with highest exam score** after 8 years of resilience.  
- 🎤 Today, I lead a MarTech team across the Americas and give **keynotes on AI** at international conferences.  
- ✍️ I'm writting and deciding to spend **more time by the ocean**.
- 
I’m fluent in **Spanish, English, and Portuguese**, and I believe technology is only as powerful as the dignity and accessibility it creates.

- **Novel in progress** → weaving ancestry, migration, and the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée (Martinique) into a story of love and resilience.

> *“Free WiFi.”*
